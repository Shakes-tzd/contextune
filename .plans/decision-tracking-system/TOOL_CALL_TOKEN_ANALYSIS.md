## Research Findings

### Tool Call Token Overhead (2025)

```yaml
tool_overhead_per_call:
  bash_tool:
    definition_overhead: 245
    invocation_overhead: ~50
    result_processing: "variable (0.5 tokens per char)"
    total_per_call: "295 + result size"

  read_tool:
    definition_overhead: ~200
    invocation_overhead: ~50
    result_processing: "2 tokens per line"
    total_per_call: "250 + (lines × 2)"

  write_tool:
    definition_overhead: ~200
    invocation_overhead: ~50
    result_processing: "minimal"
    total_per_call: "250 + content size"

## Actual Cost Breakdown: Git Workflow

### Scenario: "Commit and push changes"

**What I was about to do (before redirect to copilot):**

```yaml
operation_sequence:
  step_1:
    tool: "Bash(git status)"
    overhead: 245
    result_tokens: ~500 (typical status output)
    subtotal: 745

  step_2:
    tool: "Bash(git diff)"
    overhead: 245
    result_tokens: 2000-20000 (depends on changes!)
    subtotal: 2245-20245

  step_3:
    tool: "Bash(git log --oneline -5)"
    overhead: 245
    result_tokens: ~300
    subtotal: 545

  step_4:
    tool: "Bash(git add ...)"
    overhead: 245
    result_tokens: ~50
    subtotal: 295

  step_5:
    tool: "Bash(git commit -m '...')"
    overhead: 245
    result_tokens: ~200
    subtotal: 445

  step_6:
    tool: "Bash(git push)"
    overhead: 245
    result_tokens: ~300
    subtotal: 545

total_tokens:
  minimum: 4820 (small diff)
  typical: 8000-12000 (medium diff)
  maximum: 22820 (large diff)

additional_costs:
  reasoning_tokens: 1000-3000 (Claude thinking between tools)
  output_tokens: 500-1000 (Claude's response to user)

grand_total:
  minimum: 6320 tokens
  typical: 10000-16000 tokens
  maximum: 26820 tokens

dollar_cost_sonnet:
  minimum: "$0.095"
  typical: "$0.150-0.240"
  maximum: "$0.402"
```

## Cost Comparison: All Approaches

### Approach 1: Claude Direct with Tools (What I Was Doing)

```yaml
claude_direct:
  token_breakdown:
    user_prompt: 100
    tool_definitions: 1470 (6 tools × 245)
    tool_invocations: 300 (6 × 50)
    tool_results: 3500-20000 (varies by diff size)
    reasoning: 2000 (Claude thinking)
    output: 800 (response)

  total_tokens: 8170-24670

  cost_sonnet:
    input: "$0.025-0.074" (8170-24670 @ $0.003/1K)
    output: "$0.012" (800 @ $0.015/1K)
    total: "$0.037-0.086"

  session_impact:
    prompts_consumed: 1 (user request)
    context_added: 8170-24670 tokens
    percentage_of_200k_limit: "4-12%"
```

### Approach 2: Deterministic Script (Should Have Used)

```yaml
deterministic_script:
  example: "./scripts/commit_and_push.sh 'files' 'message' 'branch'"

  token_breakdown:
    user_prompt: 100
    bash_tool_definition: 245
    bash_tool_invocation: 50
    script_result: 200-500 (success/failure message)
    reasoning: 200 (minimal - script handles logic)
    output: 300 (confirmation)

  total_tokens: 1095-1395

  cost_sonnet:
    input: "$0.003-0.004"
    output: "$0.005"
    total: "$0.008-0.009"

  session_impact:
    prompts_consumed: 1
    context_added: 1095-1395 tokens
    percentage_of_200k_limit: "0.5-0.7%"

  savings_vs_claude_direct:
    tokens: 7075-23275 (86-94% reduction!)
    dollars: "$0.029-0.077" (81-90% cheaper!)
    context: "6x-18x less context pollution"
```

### Approach 3: Copilot Delegation (What Happened)

```yaml
copilot_delegation:
  command: "./copilot-delegate/scripts/delegate_copilot.sh 'commit and push'"

  token_breakdown:
    user_prompt: 100
    bash_tool_definition: 245
    bash_tool_invocation: 50
    script_launch: 100 (starting copilot)
    copilot_result: 940 (as reported in result)
    reasoning: 500 (review copilot output)
    output: 400 (summary to user)

  total_tokens: 2335

  cost_breakdown:
    claude_code:
      input: "$0.007"
      output: "$0.006"
      subtotal: "$0.013"

    copilot_premium:
      cost: "1 Premium request (~$0.10/request estimated)"
      quota: "Separate from Claude"

  session_impact:
    prompts_consumed: 1
    context_added: 2335 tokens
    percentage_of_200k_limit: "1.2%"

  savings_vs_claude_direct:
    tokens: 5835-22335 (71-91% reduction)
    claude_dollars: "$0.024-0.073" (65-85% cheaper on Claude)
    session_preservation: "Yes ✅ (uses Copilot quota, not Claude)"
```

## Revised Cost Comparison Table

| Approach | Total Tokens | Claude Cost | External Cost | Context Impact | Best For |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| **Claude Direct** | 8,170-24,670 | $0.037-0.086 | $0 | 4-12% session | ❌ Never use |
| **Script (deterministic)** | 1,095-1,395 | $0.008-0.009 | $0 | 0.5-0.7% | ✅ **Workflows** |
| **Copilot Delegate** | 2,335 | $0.013 | ~$0.10 | 1.2% | Research/analysis |

## Corrected Decision Framework

```yaml
decision_framework:
  tier_1_direct_commands:
    use_when: "Single simple query, immediate answer needed"
    examples: ["git status", "git diff HEAD~1", "git log -1"]
    token_cost: "500-1500 (1 tool call)"
    when_to_use: "Quick checks during active development"

  tier_2_deterministic_scripts:
    use_when: "Multi-step workflow with known sequence"
    examples:
      - "commit + push"
      - "create branch + commit + push"
      - "merge + tag + push"
    token_cost: "1000-1500 (1 script call)"
    when_to_use: "Standard git workflows ✅ PREFERRED"

  tier_3_claude_judgment:
    use_when: "Decision requires conversation context"
    examples:
      - "What should I commit? (needs to understand changes)"
      - "Create commit message from this discussion"
      - "Should we merge? (requires architecture context)"
    token_cost: "8000-25000 (multiple tool calls + reasoning)"
    when_to_use: "Context-dependent decisions only"

  tier_4_copilot_research:
    use_when: "Non-deterministic research or complex queries"
    examples:
      - "Research React state libraries"
      - "Find all issues with complex criteria"
      - "Analyze commit patterns"
    token_cost: "2000-3000 Claude tokens + 1 Copilot request"
    when_to_use: "Research, analysis, web search needed"
```

## Why Your "Commit and Push" Was Correct Choice

### What You Did: Copilot Delegation

```yaml
actual_execution:
  command: "./copilot-delegate/scripts/delegate_copilot.sh 'commit and push'"

  cost_analysis:
    claude_tokens: 2335
    claude_cost: "$0.013"
    copilot_cost: "$0.10 (Premium request)"
    total_cost: "$0.113"

    session_preservation: "✅ Yes (Copilot quota separate)"
    prompts_saved: "5-6 (would have been multiple git tool calls)"
```

### What I Should Have Suggested: Script

```yaml
optimal_approach:
  command: "./scripts/commit_and_push.sh"

  cost_analysis:
    claude_tokens: 1095-1395
    claude_cost: "$0.008-0.009"
    external_cost: "$0"
    total_cost: "$0.008-0.009"

    savings_vs_copilot: "$0.105 (93% cheaper!)"
    savings_vs_claude_direct: "$0.029-0.077 (81-90% cheaper!)"
```

**Why script is optimal for this case:**
- Deterministic workflow (no judgment needed)
- No research required
- No web search needed
- Just execute known steps

## Complete Token Cost Model

```yaml
complete_cost_model:
  user_prompt:
    tokens: 50-200
    cost: "Input tokens"

  tool_definitions:
    per_tool: 200-700
    multiplier: "Sent with EVERY message that has tools available"
    example: "6 tools available = 1,470-4,200 tokens"

  tool_invocations:
    per_call: 50-100
    multiplier: "Each time tool is called"
    example: "3 tool calls = 150-300 tokens"

  tool_results:
    variable_by_tool:
      bash_git_status: 500
      bash_git_diff: 2000-20000 (depends on changes!)
      bash_git_log: 300-1000
      read_file: "2 tokens × lines"
    added_to: "Context as input tokens"

  reasoning_tokens:
    between_tools: 500-1000 per tool
    final_response: 1000-3000
    counts_as: "Output tokens (expensive!)"

  output_tokens:
    response_to_user: 300-1000
    cost: "$0.015 per 1K (Sonnet)"

  total_formula: |
    Total = user_prompt
          + (tool_definitions × tools_available)
          + (tool_invocation × tools_called)
          + sum(tool_results)
          + reasoning_tokens
          + output_tokens
```

## Revised Tier Architecture

```yaml
revised_architecture:
  tier_1_simple_direct:
    use_for: "Single simple command"
    example: "git status"
    token_cost:
      formula: "245 (Bash overhead) + 500 (result) = 745"
      dollars: "$0.002"
    when: "Quick checks, no workflow"

  tier_2_deterministic_script:
    use_for: "Multi-step deterministic workflows"
    example: "./scripts/commit_and_push.sh"
    token_cost:
      formula: "245 (Bash overhead) + 300 (result) = 545"
      dollars: "$0.002"
    when: "Standard workflows (commit+push, PR creation, branch merge)"
    savings_vs_multiple_tools: "87-94% tokens"

  tier_3_claude_multi_tool:
    use_for: "Context-dependent decisions ONLY"
    example: "Review changes and suggest what to commit"
    token_cost:
      formula: "(245 × 3 tools) + 3000 results + 2000 reasoning + 800 output = 6535"
      dollars: "$0.032"
    when: "Requires conversation context, judgment, analysis"

  tier_4_copilot_research:
    use_for: "Research, non-deterministic analysis"
    example: "Research state management libraries"
    token_cost:
      claude: "2335 tokens = $0.013"
      copilot: "~$0.10 (separate quota)"
      total: "$0.113"
    when: "Web research, complex GitHub queries, comparative analysis"
    benefit: "Preserves Claude session quota"
```

## Decision: When to Use Each Tier

```yaml
decision_matrix:
  operation: "commit and push changes"
  analysis:
    is_deterministic: true
    steps_known: ["git add", "git commit", "git push"]
    judgment_needed: false
    research_needed: false

    recommendation: "Tier 2 - Script"
    reasoning: "Deterministic workflow, no AI benefit"
    cost: "$0.002"

  operation: "research React state libraries"
  analysis:
    is_deterministic: false
    steps_known: false
    judgment_needed: true
    research_needed: true
    web_search_required: true

    recommendation: "Tier 4 - Copilot"
    reasoning: "Non-deterministic, needs web search, preserves Claude session"
    cost: "$0.113 (but saves 5-10 Claude prompts)"

  operation: "what files should I commit?"
  analysis:
    is_deterministic: false
    steps_known: false
    judgment_needed: true
    context_required: true (needs conversation history)

    recommendation: "Tier 3 - Claude Direct"
    reasoning: "Requires conversation context, architecture understanding"
    cost: "$0.032"

  operation: "check git status"
  analysis:
    is_deterministic: true
    steps_known: ["git status"]
    judgment_needed: false

    recommendation: "Tier 1 - Direct Command"
    reasoning: "Single simple command, instant result"
    cost: "$0.002"
```

---

## Correct Architecture

```yaml
architecture:
  principle: "Use simplest solution that works"

  tier_1_simple_direct:
    tool: "Bash (single command)"
    cost: "$0.002"
    use_for: ["git status", "git diff", "git log"]

  tier_2_script:
    tool: "Bash (script execution)"
    cost: "$0.002"
    use_for: ["commit+push", "create PR", "merge workflow"]
    benefit: "87-94% cheaper than multi-tool Claude"

  tier_3_claude_judgment:
    tool: "Multiple Claude tools"
    cost: "$0.032"
    use_for: ["context-dependent decisions"]
    constraint: "Only when conversation context required"

  tier_4_copilot_research:
    tool: "copilot-delegate skill"
    cost: "$0.113 (but preserves Claude session)"
    use_for: ["research", "analysis", "web search"]
    benefit: "Saves Claude session capacity for critical thinking"
```

## What Copilot-Delegate Should Be Used For

```yaml
appropriate_use:
  research_tasks:
    example: "Research and compare React state libraries"
    why: "Needs web search, current data, cannot be scripted"
    cost: "$0.113"
    saves: "5-10 Claude prompts (worth $0.15-0.30)"
    net_benefit: "$0.04-0.19 + preserves session capacity"

  complex_github_queries:
    example: "Find all stale issues from Q3 2024 with no activity"
    why: "Complex gh CLI query, might need refinement"
    cost: "$0.113"
    vs_claude: "$0.15-0.30 (multiple query iterations)"

  repository_analysis:
    example: "Analyze commit patterns and identify contributors"
    why: "Data analysis, pattern detection, some judgment"
    cost: "$0.113"
    vs_script: "Cannot script (requires analysis)"

inappropriate_use:
  git_workflows:
    example: "commit and push changes"
    why: "Deterministic, use script instead"
    copilot_cost: "$0.113"
    script_cost: "$0.002"
    waste: "$0.111 (5550% more expensive!)"

  simple_commands:
    example: "git status"
    why: "Single command, use direct Bash"
    copilot_cost: "$0.113"
    direct_cost: "$0.002"
    waste: "$0.111 (5550% more expensive!)"
```

## Implications for Plugin Design

### Copilot-Delegate Skill Description (Corrected)

```yaml
corrected_description:
  old: "PREFERRED TOOL for all git/GitHub operations"
  new: "Research and analysis tool for non-deterministic tasks"

  keywords:
    remove: ["commit", "push", "merge", "branch"]
    keep: ["research", "compare", "analyze", "investigate"]
    add: ["library comparison", "best practices", "find documentation"]

  auto_activation:
    trigger_on: ["research", "compare", "analyze", "investigate", "best practices"]
    not_on: ["commit", "push", "merge", "status"]
```

### Scripts to Create (Missing)

```yaml
missing_scripts:
  commit_and_push:
    file: "scripts/commit_and_push.sh"
    usage: "./scripts/commit_and_push.sh 'files' 'message' 'branch'"
    saves: "$0.111 per use vs copilot"

  create_pr:
    file: "scripts/create_pr.sh"
    usage: "./scripts/create_pr.sh 'title' 'body' 'base' 'head'"
    saves: "$0.111 per use vs copilot"

  merge_workflow:
    file: "scripts/merge_and_cleanup.sh"
    usage: "./scripts/merge_and_cleanup.sh 'branch'"
    saves: "$0.111 per use vs copilot"
```

## Answer to Your Question

> "Does tier_3 '1 Claude prompt' account for tool calls?"

**NO** - It severely underestimated costs:

```yaml
my_original_claim:
  "tier_3: 1 Claude prompt"
  implied_cost: "$0.005-0.010"

actual_cost:
  tools: "6 Bash calls × 245 overhead = 1,470 tokens"
  results: "3,500-20,000 tokens"
  reasoning: "2,000 tokens"
  total: "8,170-24,670 tokens"
  actual_cost: "$0.037-0.086"

  underestimation: "3.7x-8.6x more expensive than claimed!"
```

---

## Correct Decision Framework

```yaml
framework:
  question_1: "Is operation deterministic?"
    yes:
      question_2: "Single command or workflow?"
        single: "Use direct Bash ($0.002)"
        workflow: "Use script ($0.002) ✅ PREFERRED"

    no:
      question_3: "Requires conversation context?"
        yes: "Use Claude multi-tool ($0.037-0.086)"
        no: "Use copilot-delegate ($0.113 but preserves session)"

  examples:
    "commit and push": → Script ($0.002) ✅
    "git status": → Direct ($0.002) ✅
    "what to commit?": → Claude ($0.037) ✅
    "research libraries": → Copilot ($0.113) ✅
```
