# High-level overview
overview: |
  Complete the unified decision tracking system from scratch_pad.md vision.
  Integrates extraction system (already built) with decisions.yaml tracking,
  auto-population from conversation history (1,236 conversations), and
  features.yaml integration. This is what actually solves the changelog
  bloat problem via bounded selective context loading.
