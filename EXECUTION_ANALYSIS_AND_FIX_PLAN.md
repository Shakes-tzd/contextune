# Contextune Execution Analysis & Comprehensive Fix Plan (UPDATED)

**Date:** 2025-10-27 (Updated after commit review)
**Analyzed:** feedback.md workflow execution
**Current Version:** Contextune v0.8.4
**Architecture Change:** v0.5.5 removed GitHub issues (Oct 25, 2025)
**Status:** Agent file outdated, execution behavior correct

---

## Executive Summary

**IMPORTANT UPDATE:** After reviewing recent commits, the feedback.md execution is **mostly correct**. The real issue is that the **agent specification is outdated**.

### What Actually Happened:

1. ✅ **Execution correctly skipped GitHub issues** (per v0.5.5 architecture change)
2. ✅ **Used plan.yaml as single source of truth** (correct v2 design)
3. ✅ **Worktree naming used sequential IDs** (correct for plan.yaml-based setup)
4. ❌ **Agents spawned sequentially** (still a problem - not true parallelism)
5. ⚠️ **No research phase evidence** (may have been skipped or done separately)

### The Real Disconnect:

**Agent file (`agents/parallel-task-executor.md`) is outdated:**
- Line 29 still says: "Create GitHub issue and git worktree"
- Lines 39-74 still contain GitHub issue creation code
- Never updated after v0.5.5 removed GitHub issues (Oct 25, 2025)

**Root Cause:** Documentation drift after architectural change

---

## Architecture Context: GitHub Issues Removed in v0.5.5

### Why GitHub Issues Were Eliminated

**Commit:** 446dfe0 (Oct 25, 2025)
**Rationale:** (from `copilot-delegate/OLD_VS_NEW_DESIGN.md`)

#### Problems with Old Design (v1):
- ❌ **Duplication** - Task info in both plan.yaml AND GitHub issues
- ❌ **Overhead** - 60-80 seconds to create issues for 4 tasks
- ❌ **Mapping complexity** - Required issue-mapping.json files
- ❌ **Offline dependency** - Couldn't work without GitHub
- ❌ **Version control** - .parallel/ was gitignored

#### New Design (v2) Benefits:
- ✅ **Single source of truth** - plan.yaml contains everything
- ✅ **Zero overhead** - No issue creation time
- ✅ **Git tracked** - .parallel/ committed for version control
- ✅ **Offline capable** - Works without GitHub
- ✅ **Optional GitHub** - Can still create PRs if desired

#### What This Means:
**The feedback.md execution was CORRECT to skip GitHub issues!**

The agent specification (`agents/parallel-task-executor.md`) is what's wrong - it still references the old v1 design.

---

## Critical Disconnects Identified

### 1. Agent File Outdated (DOCUMENTATION DRIFT) ❌

**Problem:** Agent spec never updated after v0.5.5 architectural change

**Current Agent File** (`agents/parallel-task-executor.md`):
- Line 29: "Create GitHub issue and git worktree"
- Lines 39-74: Full GitHub issue creation workflow
- Lines 232-238: GitHub issue updates
- Lines 280-285: GitHub issue closure

**Current Architecture** (v0.5.5+):
- No GitHub issues
- plan.yaml is source of truth
- Worktrees use sequential IDs from plan
- Status tracked in plan.yaml, not GitHub

**Impact:**
- **Confusion** - Agent spec doesn't match reality
- **Wrong expectations** - Users think issues should be created
- **Analysis errors** - My initial analysis flagged this as execution problem

### 2. Sequential Agent Spawning ⚠️

**Expected** (from `ctx-execute.md:692-747`):
- Spawn ALL agents in SINGLE response
- True parallelism from start
- No user approval gates

**Actual** (feedback.md lines 100, 127, 226, 233):
- Agents spawned ONE or TWO at a time
- User approval required between phases
- Lost parallelism benefits

### 3. Worktree Naming Mismatch ⚠️

**Expected:** `worktrees/task-{ISSUE_NUM}` (from GitHub issue)  
**Actual:** `worktrees/task-0`, `worktrees/task-1`, etc. (sequential)

**Impact:** Agent spec expects issue numbers, setup uses sequential IDs

### 4. No Research Phase Evidence ❌

**Expected** (from `ctx-plan.md:62-268`):
- 5 parallel research agents
- Grounded in current date/specs
- Research synthesis in plan

**Actual:** No evidence of research agents

### 5. Manual Integration Required ⚠️

**Expected:** Automated PR creation  
**Actual:** Manual merging with conflict resolution (lines 1038-1153)

---

## Comprehensive Fix Plan

### Priority 1: Align Worktree Naming (HIGH)

**Problem:** Mismatch between setup script (sequential IDs) and agent expectations (issue numbers).

**Solution Options:**

**Option A: Issues First, Then Worktrees** (Recommended)
```
Phase 0a: Create GitHub Issues
  - Spawn N issue-creator micro-agents
  - Each creates ONE issue from task spec
  - Capture issue numbers
  - Parallel execution (~10s)

Phase 0b: Create Worktrees with Issue Numbers
  - Update setup_worktrees.sh to accept issue numbers
  - Create: worktrees/task-{ISSUE_NUM}
  - Branches: feature/task-{ISSUE_NUM}
```

**Option B: Keep Sequential, Update Agents**
```
Agent Updates:
  - Use pre-created worktrees/task-N
  - Create issue AFTER entering worktree
  - Link issue to branch in issue body
```

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Choose option based on team preference
- [ ] Update `ctx-execute.md` Phase 0
- [ ] Update `parallel-task-executor.md` workflow
- [ ] Update/create `setup_worktrees.sh`
- [ ] Test with 3-task plan

**Estimated Effort:** 15K-30K tokens

---

### Priority 2: Fix Sequential Spawning (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Agents not spawned all at once despite documentation saying "SINGLE response".

**Solution:** Make instructions more explicit with examples and guardrails.

**Updates to `ctx-execute.md`:**

Add at line 692:
```markdown
## CRITICAL RULE: Spawn ALL Agents in ONE Message!

**Correct Approach:**
Send ONE message with multiple Task tool invocations:

Example with 3 tasks:
"I will now spawn all 3 agents in parallel using a single message with 3 Task tool calls."

[Use Task tool 3 times in single message]
- Task 1: description="Task 0 Setup", subagent_type="contextune:agent:parallel-task-executor"
- Task 2: description="Task 1 Feature A", subagent_type="contextune:agent:parallel-task-executor"  
- Task 3: description="Task 2 Feature B", subagent_type="contextune:agent:parallel-task-executor"

**WRONG Approach (DO NOT DO THIS):**
- Spawning one agent, waiting for completion, then spawning next ❌
- Asking user "Should I continue?" between agents ❌
- Spawning in "phases" with approval gates ❌

**Validation Check:**
After spawning, you should see N agent responses simultaneously, not one at a time.
```

Add dependency checking logic:
```markdown
## Handling Dependencies

**If tasks have dependencies:**
1. Group tasks by dependency level
2. Spawn Level 0 tasks (no deps) in parallel - SINGLE message
3. Wait for Level 0 completion
4. Spawn Level 1 tasks (depend on Level 0) in parallel - SINGLE message
5. Continue until all levels complete

**Example:**
- Level 0: task-0 (setup) - spawn alone
- Level 1: task-1, task-2, task-3 (depend on task-0) - spawn ALL in SINGLE message
- Level 2: task-4 (depends on task-1, task-2) - spawn alone
```

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Add explicit "CRITICAL RULE" section to `ctx-execute.md`
- [ ] Add correct/incorrect examples
- [ ] Add dependency level handling logic
- [ ] Add validation checks after spawning
- [ ] Test with 5-task plan (2 independent, 3 with deps)

**Estimated Effort:** 10K-15K tokens

---

### Priority 3: Enforce Parallel Research in Planning (MEDIUM)

**Problem:** No evidence of parallel research phase from `/ctx:plan`.

**Solution:** Make research phase mandatory and add validation.

**Updates to `ctx-plan.md`:**

At line 62, make Step 2 non-optional:
```markdown
## Step 2: Parallel Research (MANDATORY)

**YOU MUST execute this step before planning!**

Spawn ALL 5 research agents in a SINGLE message:

Example output:
"I will now spawn 5 research agents in parallel to gather comprehensive information before planning."

[Use Task tool 5 times in single message]
- Agent 1: subagent_type="general-purpose", description="Research similar solutions"
- Agent 2: subagent_type="general-purpose", description="Research libraries/tools"
- Agent 3: subagent_type="general-purpose", description="Search codebase patterns"
- Agent 4: subagent_type="general-purpose", description="Validate specifications"
- Agent 5: subagent_type="general-purpose", description="Analyze dependencies"

**Validation:** You MUST receive 5 agent reports before proceeding to Step 3.

**If you skip this:** The plan will not be grounded in current reality!
```

Add research validation at Step 5 (line 638):
```markdown
## Research Validation

Before creating plan.yaml, verify:
- [ ] All 5 research agents completed
- [ ] Research synthesis written
- [ ] Architectural decisions documented
- [ ] Libraries/tools selected with reasoning
- [ ] Existing code patterns identified

If ANY check fails, STOP and complete research phase first.
```

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Make Step 2 mandatory (not "NEW!" optional)
- [ ] Add validation checklist at Step 5
- [ ] Add research synthesis to plan.yaml template
- [ ] Update examples to show research results
- [ ] Test planning with and without research

**Estimated Effort:** 10K-20K tokens

---

### Priority 4: Add Automated Integration Strategy (MEDIUM)

**Problem:** Manual merging required at end with conflicts.

**Solution:** Add automated integration checks and conflict resolution guidance.

**New Section in `ctx-execute.md`:**

Add after Phase 5 (line 844):
```markdown
## Phase 5.5: Automated Integration Validation (BEFORE PR Creation)

**Before creating PRs, validate integration:**

1. **Detect Potential Conflicts:**
```bash
# For each completed branch
for task in task-0 task-1 task-2; do
  git merge-tree $(git merge-base main feature/$task) main feature/$task
done
```

2. **If conflicts detected:**
```
Option A: Create integration branch
- Merge all branches to integration/feature-name
- Resolve conflicts in integration branch
- Test integration branch
- Create single PR from integration branch

Option B: Create individual PRs with conflict warnings
- Create PR for each task
- Add comment about potential conflicts
- User resolves during PR review
```

3. **If no conflicts:**
```
Proceed with Phase 6: Create PRs normally
```

**Automated Conflict Resolution Patterns:**

**Pattern 1: Same file, different sections**
- Usually auto-merges fine
- Run tests after merge to verify

**Pattern 2: Same file, overlapping changes**
- Requires manual resolution
- Create integration branch
- Document resolution strategy in commit

**Pattern 3: Database schema conflicts**
- ALWAYS require manual review
- Coordinate schema changes across tasks
- May need to reorder migrations
```

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Add Phase 5.5 to `ctx-execute.md`
- [ ] Add conflict detection script
- [ ] Add resolution strategy guide
- [ ] Add integration branch workflow
- [ ] Test with conflicting tasks

**Estimated Effort:** 10K-15K tokens

---

### Priority 5: Add Execution Mode Validation (LOW)

**Problem:** Unclear if execution was using correct version/mode.

**Solution:** Add version checks and mode validation at start.

**Add to `ctx-execute.md` Phase 0:**

```markdown
## Phase 0: Version and Mode Validation

**Before starting execution, validate:**

1. **Check Contextune Version:**
```bash
# Check plugin.json version
cat .claude-plugin/plugin.json | grep '"version"'

# Expected: 0.8.4 or higher
```

2. **Verify Commands Match Version:**
```bash
# Check if commands have required features
grep -q "Parallel Research" commands/ctx-plan.md
grep -q "GitHub issue creation" agents/parallel-task-executor.md

# If missing, user may have older version
```

3. **Check Execution Mode:**
```
Are you in:
- ✅ Autonomous mode (spawn all, no approval gates)
- ❌ Interactive mode (ask before each step)

Expected: Autonomous mode

If interactive mode detected:
"Warning: Execution appears to be in interactive mode. 
For true parallelism, all agents should be spawned in a single response.
Continue in autonomous mode? [y/n]"
```

4. **Verify Auto-Approval:**
```bash
# Check if git commands auto-approved
# (from user's settings or hooks.json)

If NOT auto-approved:
"⚠️ WARNING: Auto-approval not configured!
You will need to manually approve EVERY git command from EVERY agent.
This defeats the purpose of parallel execution.

Configure auto-approval: /permissions
Or continue with manual approval? [y/n]"
```

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Add Phase 0 validation section
- [ ] Add version check
- [ ] Add mode detection
- [ ] Add auto-approval check
- [ ] Add warnings for misconfigurations

**Estimated Effort:** 5K-10K tokens

---

## Testing Strategy

After implementing fixes, test with:

### Test 1: Simple 3-Task Plan (No Dependencies)
**Goal:** Verify true parallel spawning

```
Tasks:
- task-0: Add button to header
- task-1: Add logging utility
- task-2: Update README

Expected:
- All 3 agents spawn in ONE message
- All 3 work simultaneously
- 3 PRs created automatically
- No conflicts
```

### Test 2: 5-Task Plan with Dependencies
**Goal:** Verify dependency handling

```
Tasks:
- task-0: Setup (Level 0)
- task-1, task-2, task-3: Independent features (Level 1, depend on task-0)
- task-4: Integration (Level 2, depends on task-1, task-2, task-3)

Expected:
- task-0 spawns alone
- task-1, task-2, task-3 spawn in ONE message after task-0
- task-4 spawns after Level 1 complete
```

### Test 3: Plan with Research
**Goal:** Verify research phase execution

```
Scenario: "Plan parallel development for user authentication"

Expected:
- 5 research agents spawn in ONE message
- Research synthesis added to plan
- Architectural decisions documented
- Libraries selected with reasoning
```

### Test 4: Conflicting Tasks
**Goal:** Verify integration validation

```
Tasks:
- task-0: Add field to User model
- task-1: Add different field to User model

Expected:
- Phase 5.5 detects potential conflict
- Integration branch created
- Conflicts resolved automatically OR flagged
```

---

## Migration Guide for Existing Plans

If users have existing plans from older versions:

### Plan Format Migration

**Old Format (pre-v0.4.0):**
```yaml
# No research section
# No task names in index
# Time estimates included
```

**New Format (v0.8.4):**
```yaml
research:
  approach: "..."
  libraries: [...]
  patterns: [...]
  
tasks:
  - id: "task-0"
    name: "Task Name Here"  # NEW!
    priority: "high"  # Not "days: 1-2"
```

**Migration Script:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# migrate_plan.sh - Migrate old plan to new format

OLD_PLAN="$1"

if [ ! -f "$OLD_PLAN" ]; then
  echo "Usage: ./migrate_plan.sh path/to/old/plan.yaml"
  exit 1
fi

# Extract tasks
# Add research section (mark as "legacy - no research")
# Remove time estimates
# Add task names to index
# Update to new priority system

echo "Migrating $OLD_PLAN to new format..."
# (implementation details...)
echo "✅ Migration complete!"
```

## Success Criteria

Execution is considered "fixed" when:

- ✅ GitHub issues created for every task
- ✅ ALL agents spawn in SINGLE response (true parallelism)
- ✅ Worktree naming matches agent expectations
- ✅ Research phase executes automatically in planning
- ✅ Integration validation catches conflicts early
- ✅ Test suite passes (all 4 test scenarios)
- ✅ No manual intervention required (except conflict resolution)
- ✅ Cost savings maintained (85% via Haiku agents)
- ✅ Performance improvements delivered (2x speedup)

---

## Open Questions

1. **Q:** Should we support both sequential and issue-number worktree naming?  
   **A:** TBD - need team input

2. **Q:** What if user prefers manual mode over autonomous?  
   **A:** Add `--mode` flag to commands? Auto-detect from behavior?

3. **Q:** How to handle research phase for quick/simple tasks?  
   **A:** Add `--skip-research` flag? Make research optional for <3 tasks?

4. **Q:** Should we enforce GitHub auth check before execution?  
   **A:** Yes - add `gh auth status` check in Phase 0

5. **Q:** What if older versions of Contextune are in use?  
   **A:** Add version detection and show upgrade prompt

---

## Conclusion

The feedback.md execution reveals significant gaps between documented architecture and actual behavior. The core issues are:

1. **Missing GitHub integration** (no issues created)
2. **Sequential spawning** (not true parallelism)
3. **Inconsistent naming** (worktrees vs agent expectations)
4. **Missing research** (plan not grounded)
5. **Manual integration** (defeats automation)

**Priority Order:**
1. Fix sequential spawning (CRITICAL - blocks parallelism)
2. Align worktree naming (HIGH - blocks agent autonomy)
3. Enforce research (MEDIUM - improves quality)
4. Add integration validation (MEDIUM - improves UX)
5. Add version checks (LOW - nice to have)

**Estimated Total Effort:** 50K-90K tokens across all priorities

**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks for full implementation and testing

**Risk Level:** Medium
- Breaking changes possible (worktree naming)
- User migration required (plan format)
- Extensive testing needed (4 test scenarios)

**Recommendation:** Start with Priority 1 (sequential spawning) as quick win, then tackle worktree naming as this requires coordination between multiple files.

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** 2025-10-27  
**Status:** Ready for Review  
**Next Steps:** Present to team, get feedback, prioritize implementation

## Comprehensive Fix Plan (REVISED)

### Priority 1: Update Agent File to Match v0.5.5 Architecture (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** `agents/parallel-task-executor.md` still references GitHub issues removed 2 days ago

**Solution:** Remove all GitHub issue references, align with plan.yaml-based workflow

**Changes Needed:**

1. **Line 29 - Core Mission:**
```markdown
# OLD:
1. **Setup**: Create GitHub issue and git worktree

# NEW:
1. **Setup**: Navigate to pre-created worktree
```

2. **Lines 39-89 - Remove Entire Phase 1:**
```markdown
# DELETE:
### Phase 1: Environment Setup
#### Step 1: Create GitHub Issue
#### Step 2: Create Git Worktree  
#### Step 3: Setup Development Environment

# REPLACE WITH:
### Phase 1: Environment Setup
#### Step 1: Navigate to Worktree
```bash
# Worktree already created by setup script
cd worktrees/{task.id}

# Verify correct worktree
echo "Working in: $(pwd)"
echo "Branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
```

#### Step 2: Update Task Status
```bash
# Update plan.yaml status to in_progress
TASK_FILE=".parallel/plans/active/tasks/{task.id}.md"
sed -i.bak 's/^status: pending$/status: in_progress/' "$TASK_FILE"
git add "$TASK_FILE" && git commit -m "chore: start {task.id}"
```

#### Step 3: Setup Development Environment
# (existing content - keep as is)
```

3. **Lines 232-238 - Remove Issue Updates:**
```markdown
# DELETE:
If stuck, update GitHub issue:
```bash
gh issue comment $ISSUE_NUM --body "..."
```

# REPLACE WITH:
If stuck, update task status:
```bash
sed -i.bak 's/^status: .*$/status: blocked/' "$TASK_FILE"
git add "$TASK_FILE" && git commit -m "chore: block {task.id} - {reason}"
```

4. **Lines 246-285 - Update Deployment Phase:**
```markdown
# OLD Phase 4: Deployment
- Push changes
- Update GitHub issue
- Close GitHub issue

# NEW Phase 4: Deployment
- Push changes
- Update task status to completed
- Report back
```

5. **Lines 384-407 - Update Rules:**
```markdown
# DELETE:
- ✅ Create GitHub issue first (to get issue number)

# ADD:
- ✅ Update task status at key milestones
```

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Edit `agents/parallel-task-executor.md`
- [ ] Remove all GitHub issue code (save ~100 lines)
- [ ] Add plan.yaml status update logic
- [ ] Update examples to show new workflow
- [ ] Test with simple 1-task plan

**Estimated Effort:** 10K-15K tokens

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Agent spec matches architecture
- ✅ No confusion about GitHub requirements
- ✅ Simpler agent (~20% smaller context)
- ✅ Faster (no GitHub API calls)

---

### Priority 2: Fix Sequential Agent Spawning (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Agents spawned one at a time or with approval gates (feedback.md lines 100, 127, 226, 233)

**Solution:** Make "spawn ALL in SINGLE response" instruction more explicit

**Updates to `ctx-execute.md`:**

Add at line 692:
```markdown
## ⚡ CRITICAL RULE: Spawn ALL Independent Agents in ONE Message!

**How Parallel Execution Works:**

You MUST spawn all independent agents in a SINGLE Claude Code response. This means using multiple Task tool invocations in one message.

**Correct Example (3 tasks):**
```
I will now spawn all 3 agents in parallel using a single message.

[Response contains 3 Task tool calls]
- Task 1: subagent_type="contextune:agent:parallel-task-executor"
- Task 2: subagent_type="contextune:agent:parallel-task-executor"
- Task 3: subagent_type="contextune:agent:parallel-task-executor"
```

**WRONG Examples (DO NOT DO THIS):**
❌ Spawn task-0, wait for completion, ask "Should I continue?"
❌ Spawn task-0, then task-1, then task-2 (sequential)
❌ Ask user approval between each spawn

**With Dependencies:**
```
Level 0 tasks (no deps): Spawn ALL in ONE message
Wait for Level 0 completion
Level 1 tasks (depend on Level 0): Spawn ALL in ONE message
...
```

**Validation:**
After spawning, you should see N agent responses arrive simultaneously.
If you see one response, wait, then another - you did it WRONG.
```

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Add explicit rule with examples
- [ ] Add wrong example warnings
- [ ] Add dependency level logic
- [ ] Update Phase 2 instructions
- [ ] Test with 5-task plan

**Estimated Effort:** 5K-10K tokens

---

### Priority 3: Verify Research Phase Execution (MEDIUM)

**Problem:** No evidence of parallel research in feedback.md

**Solution:** Add validation that research phase executed

**Updates to `ctx-plan.md`:**

At line 62, add validation:
```markdown
## Step 2: Parallel Research (MANDATORY - Do Not Skip!)

**CRITICAL:** You MUST execute this step! Plans without research are not grounded.

**Validation Check:**
Before proceeding to Step 3, verify you have:
- [ ] Spawned 5 research agents in SINGLE message
- [ ] Received 5 research reports
- [ ] Created research synthesis
- [ ] Documented architectural decisions

**If any check fails:** Stop and complete research first!

**How to verify research was done:**
After creating plan, check for research section in plan.yaml:
```bash
grep -A 10 "^research:" .parallel/plans/plan.yaml
```

Should output research findings, not "not conducted" or missing.
```

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Make Step 2 non-optional
- [ ] Add validation checklist
- [ ] Add grep check in Step 5
- [ ] Update examples to show research results
- [ ] Test planning workflow

**Estimated Effort:** 5K-10K tokens

---

### Priority 4: Add Integration Validation (LOW)

**Problem:** Manual merging required in feedback.md (lines 1038-1153)

**Solution:** Add conflict detection before PR creation

**New Phase in `ctx-execute.md`:**

Add after Phase 5 (line 844):
```markdown
## Phase 5.5: Integration Validation

**Before creating PRs, check for conflicts:**

```bash
# Detect potential conflicts
for task in $(ls worktrees/); do
  git merge-tree $(git merge-base main feature/$task) main feature/$task > /tmp/$task.conflicts
  if grep -q "CONFLICT" /tmp/$task.conflicts; then
    echo "⚠️ Potential conflict in $task"
  fi
done
```

**If conflicts detected:**
- Create integration branch
- Merge all tasks to integration branch
- Resolve conflicts
- Test integration branch
- Create single PR from integration branch

**If no conflicts:**
- Proceed with individual PRs (Phase 6)
```

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Add Phase 5.5
- [ ] Add conflict detection script
- [ ] Add resolution workflow
- [ ] Test with conflicting tasks

**Estimated Effort:** 5K-10K tokens

---

## Updated Success Criteria

Execution is considered "fixed" when:

- ✅ Agent file matches v0.5.5 architecture (no GitHub issues)
- ✅ ALL agents spawn in SINGLE response (true parallelism)
- ✅ Research phase executes and validates
- ✅ Integration validation catches conflicts early
- ✅ Test suite passes (updated test scenarios)
- ✅ Cost savings maintained (Haiku agents)
- ✅ Performance improvements delivered

---

## Implementation Priority

1. **Week 1: Update Agent File** (Priority 1)
   - Critical documentation fix
   - Removes confusion
   - Quick win (~2 hours)

2. **Week 1-2: Fix Sequential Spawning** (Priority 2)
   - Add explicit instructions
   - Test with examples
   - High impact

3. **Week 2: Verify Research** (Priority 3)
   - Add validation
   - Update examples
   - Medium impact

4. **Week 3: Integration Validation** (Priority 4)
   - Nice to have
   - Prevents manual work
   - Low priority

---

## Conclusion (REVISED)

**Major Finding:** The feedback.md execution was mostly correct!

The real problem: **Documentation drift**. The agent file wasn't updated after the v0.5.5 architectural change that removed GitHub issues.

**What's Actually Working:**
- ✅ No GitHub issues created (correct per v0.5.5)
- ✅ plan.yaml as source of truth (correct v2 design)
- ✅ Sequential worktree IDs (correct for plan.yaml setup)
- ✅ Manual merging handled conflicts (expected with parallel streams)

**What Needs Fixing:**
1. ❌ Agent file outdated (CRITICAL - causes confusion)
2. ❌ Sequential spawning (CRITICAL - blocks parallelism)
3. ⚠️ Research validation (MEDIUM - ensures quality)
4. ⚠️ Integration checks (LOW - improves UX)

**Estimated Total Effort:** 25K-45K tokens (much less than original 50K-90K!)

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks (vs original 3-4 weeks)

**Risk Level:** Low (mostly documentation updates, no breaking changes)

**Recommendation:** Start with Priority 1 (agent file update) as it's quick and removes major confusion, then tackle Priority 2 (sequential spawning) for performance gains.

**Document Version:** 2.0 (Revised after commit review)
**Created:** 2025-10-27  
**Updated:** 2025-10-27 (after discovering v0.5.5 changes)
**Status:** Ready for implementation
**Next Steps:** 
1. Update agent file to match current architecture
2. Add explicit parallel spawning rules
3. Validate research phase execution
