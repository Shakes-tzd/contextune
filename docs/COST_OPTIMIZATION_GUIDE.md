## Three-Tier Architecture Explained

### The Problem We're Solving

**Before Optimization (All Sonnet):**

```
Every operation uses Sonnet 4.5
├─ Planning: Sonnet ($0.03)
├─ Guidance: Sonnet ($0.02)
├─ Execution #1: Sonnet ($0.27)
├─ Execution #2: Sonnet ($0.27)
├─ Execution #3: Sonnet ($0.27)
└─ Review: Sonnet ($0.02)

Total: $0.88 per workflow
```

**The insight:** Most of the work is repetitive execution that doesn't need Sonnet's advanced reasoning.

### The Solution: Three-Tier Intelligence

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tier 1: SKILLS (Educational)               │
│ Model: Sonnet 4.5 (in main conversation)   │
│ Purpose: Teaching, guidance, recommendations│
│ Cost: Minimal (educational value)           │
│ Example: parallel-development-expert        │
│          explains when to parallelize       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↓ (user decides)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tier 2: ORCHESTRATION (Planning)           │
│ Model: Sonnet 4.5 (main agent)             │
│ Purpose: Complex reasoning, planning        │
│ Cost: ~$0.03-0.05 per workflow              │
│ Example: Analyzes tasks, validates          │
│          independence, creates plan         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↓ (delegates)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tier 3: EXECUTION (Doing)                  │
│ Model: Haiku 4.5 (isolated agents)         │
│ Purpose: Repetitive, well-defined tasks    │
│ Cost: ~$0.04 per agent                      │
│ Example: Creates issue, worktree, executes │
│          tests, pushes changes              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Total: $0.15-0.20 per workflow
Savings: 80% vs all-Sonnet
```

### Why This Works

**Tier 1 (Skills) - Educational Value**

Skills run in the main conversation but provide autonomous guidance:

```
User: "I have three tasks to work on"
↓
Skill (parallel-development-expert) automatically activates:
├─ Analyzes if tasks are independent
├─ Recommends parallelization
├─ Quantifies potential savings
└─ Explains the approach

Cost: $0.01 (part of main conversation)
Value: User makes informed decision
ROI: ∞ (prevents costly mistakes)
```

**Tier 2 (Orchestration) - Strategic Thinking**

Main agent does the complex reasoning:

```
User: "Yes, let's do it"
↓
Main Agent (Sonnet):
├─ Validates task independence
├─ Checks for file conflicts
├─ Creates detailed execution plan
├─ Estimates cost and duration
└─ Delegates to Haiku agents

Cost: $0.03-0.05
Value: Proper planning prevents rework
ROI: Saves hours of manual coordination
```

**Tier 3 (Execution) - Efficient Doing**

Haiku agents handle the repetitive work:

```
Haiku Agent × 3 (parallel):
├─ Create GitHub issues
├─ Create git worktrees
├─ Implement features
├─ Run tests
└─ Push changes

Cost: 3 × $0.04 = $0.12
Value: Fast, parallel execution
ROI: 80% savings vs Sonnet agents
```

### The Magic: Right Tool for the Job

| Activity | Complexity | Model | Why |
|----------|-----------|-------|-----|
| Teaching user | High | Sonnet | Requires explanation, persuasion |
| Planning tasks | High | Sonnet | Requires analysis, validation |
| Creating issues | Low | Haiku | Template-based, repetitive |
| Running tests | Low | Haiku | Automated, no decisions |
| Resolving conflicts | High | Sonnet | Requires judgment |
| Pushing changes | Low | Haiku | Simple git commands |

**Result:** 80% of work done by Haiku, 20% by Sonnet, massive cost savings!

  net_benefit_year_2: $4,896.00 (pure savings)
```

### ROI Beyond Direct Costs

**Time Savings:**

```yaml
parallel_execution_benefit:
  old_sequential:
    5_tasks: 5 × 30 mins = 150 mins = 2.5 hours
    cost_at_$100/hr: $250

  new_parallel:
    5_tasks: 30 mins (all at once)
    cost_at_$100/hr: $50

```

**Quality Improvements:**

```yaml
reduced_context_switching:
  old_way:
    manual_task_management: 10 mins per task
    cost: 5 tasks × 10 mins × $100/hr = $83.33

  new_way:
    automated_orchestration: 0 mins
    savings: $83.33 per workflow

reduced_errors:
  old_way:
    manual_errors: 10% of tasks need rework
    rework_cost: 5 tasks × 10% × 30 mins × $100/hr = $25

  new_way:
    automated_validation: 2% need rework
    rework_cost: 5 tasks × 2% × 30 mins × $100/hr = $5
    savings: $20 per workflow

### Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Urgent Production Bug

```yaml
scenario:
  urgency: Critical
  complexity: High
  timeline: 2 hours

decision: Use Sonnet for everything
reasoning:
  - User impact is severe
  - Need fastest possible resolution
  - Complex debugging required
  - Cost is irrelevant vs downtime

approach:
  - Sonnet investigates issue: $0.15
  - Sonnet implements fix: $0.30
  - Sonnet tests fix: $0.15
  - Sonnet deploys: $0.10
  total_cost: $0.70

comparison:
  haiku_approach:
    cost: $0.15
    time: 3 hours (too slow!)
    risk: Might miss edge cases

  conclusion: Pay 467% more, save 1 hour, reduce risk
  roi: Downtime cost >> AI cost
```

#### Example 2: Feature Development Sprint

```yaml
scenario:
  urgency: Medium
  complexity: Medium
  timeline: 1 week

decision: Use hybrid approach
reasoning:
  - Time available for proper workflow
  - Multiple tasks to parallelize
  - Cost matters over many tasks
  - Quality critical

approach:
  - Sonnet plans sprint: $0.05
  - 10 × Haiku agents implement: $0.43
  - Sonnet reviews: $0.05
  total_cost: $0.53

comparison:
  all_sonnet_approach:
    cost: $2.56
    time: Same
    quality: Same

  conclusion: Save $2.03 (79%), same quality and speed
  roi: Pure savings
```

#### Example 3: Code Migration

```yaml
scenario:
  urgency: Low
  complexity: Low
  timeline: 1 month

decision: Aggressive Haiku optimization
reasoning:
  - Not time-sensitive
  - Highly repetitive
  - Large volume of tasks
  - Budget-conscious

approach:
  - Sonnet creates migration template: $0.10 (one-time)
  - 100 × Haiku agents migrate files: $4.30
  - Haiku runs tests: $0.30
  - Sonnet spot-checks: $0.05
  total_cost: $4.75

comparison:
  all_sonnet_approach:
    cost: $25.80
    time: Same (parallel)
    quality: Same

  manual_approach:
    cost: 100 files × 30 mins × $100/hr = $5,000
    time: 50 hours
    risk: Human errors

  conclusion:
    vs_sonnet: Save $21.05 (82%)
    vs_manual: Save $4,995.25 (99.9%)
    roi: Massive
```

## Measuring Actual Costs

### Instrumentation Strategy

#### 1. Token Tracking

**Add to agent scripts:**

```python
import json
import time

class CostTracker:
    def __init__(self, agent_id, model):
        self.agent_id = agent_id
        self.model = model
        self.start_time = time.time()
        self.input_tokens = 0
        self.output_tokens = 0

    def track_request(self, input_tokens, output_tokens):
        self.input_tokens += input_tokens
        self.output_tokens += output_tokens

    def calculate_cost(self):
        pricing = {
            "sonnet-4.5": {"input": 3.00, "output": 15.00},
            "haiku-4.5": {"input": 0.80, "output": 4.00}
        }

        rates = pricing[self.model]
        input_cost = (self.input_tokens / 1_000_000) * rates["input"]
        output_cost = (self.output_tokens / 1_000_000) * rates["output"]
        total_cost = input_cost + output_cost

        return {
            "agent_id": self.agent_id,
            "model": self.model,
            "duration_seconds": time.time() - self.start_time,
            "input_tokens": self.input_tokens,
            "output_tokens": self.output_tokens,
            "input_cost_usd": round(input_cost, 4),
            "output_cost_usd": round(output_cost, 4),
            "total_cost_usd": round(total_cost, 4)
        }

# Usage in agent
tracker = CostTracker("parallel-task-executor-1", "haiku-4.5")

# After each API call
tracker.track_request(input_tokens=30000, output_tokens=5000)

# At end of task
cost_report = tracker.calculate_cost()
print(json.dumps(cost_report, indent=2))
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "agent_id": "parallel-task-executor-1",
  "model": "haiku-4.5",
  "duration_seconds": 180,
  "input_tokens": 30000,
  "output_tokens": 5000,
  "input_cost_usd": 0.024,
  "output_cost_usd": 0.02,
  "total_cost_usd": 0.044
}
```

#### 2. Workflow Tracking

**Aggregate costs across workflow:**

```python
class WorkflowCostTracker:
    def __init__(self, workflow_id):
        self.workflow_id = workflow_id
        self.agents = []

    def add_agent(self, cost_report):
        self.agents.append(cost_report)

    def calculate_total(self):
        total_cost = sum(agent["total_cost_usd"] for agent in self.agents)
        total_duration = max(agent["duration_seconds"] for agent in self.agents)

        # Calculate what it would have cost with all Sonnet
        sonnet_cost = 0
        for agent in self.agents:
            if agent["model"] == "haiku-4.5":
                # Convert to Sonnet pricing
                input_cost = (agent["input_tokens"] / 1_000_000) * 3.00
                output_cost = (agent["output_tokens"] / 1_000_000) * 15.00
                sonnet_cost += input_cost + output_cost
            else:
                sonnet_cost += agent["total_cost_usd"]

        savings = sonnet_cost - total_cost
        savings_pct = (savings / sonnet_cost * 100) if sonnet_cost > 0 else 0

        return {
            "workflow_id": self.workflow_id,
            "total_agents": len(self.agents),
            "total_cost_usd": round(total_cost, 4),
            "total_duration_seconds": total_duration,
            "if_all_sonnet_usd": round(sonnet_cost, 4),
            "savings_usd": round(savings, 4),
            "savings_percent": round(savings_pct, 1)
        }

# Usage
workflow = WorkflowCostTracker("workflow-001")
workflow.add_agent(agent1_cost)
workflow.add_agent(agent2_cost)
workflow.add_agent(agent3_cost)

summary = workflow.calculate_total()
print(json.dumps(summary, indent=2))
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "workflow-001",
  "total_agents": 3,
  "total_cost_usd": 0.132,
  "total_duration_seconds": 180,
  "if_all_sonnet_usd": 0.744,
  "savings_usd": 0.612,
  "savings_percent": 82.3
}
```

#### 3. Historical Tracking

**Store in SQLite database:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE workflow_costs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    workflow_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    total_agents INTEGER,
    total_cost_usd REAL,
    total_duration_seconds INTEGER,
    if_all_sonnet_usd REAL,
    savings_usd REAL,
    savings_percent REAL
);

CREATE TABLE agent_costs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    workflow_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    agent_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    model TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    duration_seconds INTEGER,
    input_tokens INTEGER,
    output_tokens INTEGER,
    total_cost_usd REAL,
    FOREIGN KEY (workflow_id) REFERENCES workflow_costs(workflow_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_workflow_timestamp ON workflow_costs(timestamp);
CREATE INDEX idx_agent_workflow ON agent_costs(workflow_id);
```

**Query examples:**

```sql
-- Total cost this month
SELECT SUM(total_cost_usd) as monthly_cost
FROM workflow_costs
WHERE timestamp >= date('now', 'start of month');

#### 4. Real-Time Dashboard

**Generate cost report:**

```python
def generate_cost_report(db_path):
    import sqlite3
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)

    # This month's stats
    this_month = conn.execute("""
        SELECT
            COUNT(*) as workflows,
            SUM(total_agents) as agents,
            SUM(total_cost_usd) as cost,
            SUM(savings_usd) as savings,
            AVG(savings_percent) as avg_savings_pct
        FROM workflow_costs
        WHERE timestamp >= date('now', 'start of month')
    """).fetchone()

    # Top cost drivers
    top_costs = conn.execute("""
        SELECT workflow_id, total_cost_usd
        FROM workflow_costs
        ORDER BY total_cost_usd DESC
        LIMIT 5
    """).fetchall()

    # Model distribution
    model_dist = conn.execute("""
        SELECT
            model,
            COUNT(*) as count,
            SUM(total_cost_usd) as cost
        FROM agent_costs
        WHERE timestamp >= date('now', 'start of month')
        GROUP BY model
    """).fetchall()

    conn.close()

    return {
        "this_month": {
            "workflows": this_month[0],
            "agents": this_month[1],
            "cost_usd": round(this_month[2], 2),
            "savings_usd": round(this_month[3], 2),
            "avg_savings_percent": round(this_month[4], 1)
        },
        "top_expensive_workflows": [
            {"id": w[0], "cost": w[1]} for w in top_costs
        ],
        "model_distribution": [
            {"model": m[0], "count": m[1], "cost": m[2]} for m in model_dist
        ]
    }

# Usage
report = generate_cost_report("costs.db")
print(json.dumps(report, indent=2))

## Best Practices for Cost Efficiency

### 1. Minimize Context Size

**Bad (high cost):**

```python
# Sending entire codebase
context = {
    "all_files": read_all_files(),  # 100K tokens!
    "git_history": get_git_log(),   # 20K tokens!
    "dependencies": get_all_deps()  # 10K tokens!
}
# Total: 130K tokens × $3.00/M = $0.39 per request!
```

**Good (low cost):**

```python
# Sending only relevant context
context = {
    "files": [
        read_file("src/components/Navigation.tsx"),  # 500 tokens
        read_file("src/auth/AuthContext.tsx")        # 300 tokens
    ],
    "task_requirements": task_description  # 200 tokens
}
# Total: 1K tokens × $3.00/M = $0.003 per request
# Savings: 99.2%!
```

### 2. Use Templates

**Create reusable templates:**

```yaml
# templates/feature-implementation.yaml
task:
  steps:
    - "Read existing code"
    - "Implement {feature_name}"
    - "Add tests"
    - "Run test suite"
    - "Push changes"
  tests:
    - "Feature works correctly"
    - "No regressions"

# Usage (minimal tokens)
agent_task:
  template: "feature-implementation"
  variables:
    feature_name: "logout button"

# vs sending full description every time
# Savings: ~80% of task description tokens
```

### 3. Batch Operations

**Bad (multiple API calls):**

```python
# 5 separate calls
for i in range(5):
    create_github_issue(task[i])
    # Cost: 5 × $0.01 = $0.05
```

**Good (single batch call):**

```python
# 1 call with all tasks
create_github_issues_batch(tasks)
# Cost: $0.02
# Savings: 60%
```

### 4. Cache Common Patterns

**Cache expensive computations:**

```python
import functools

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def analyze_codebase_structure():
    """Expensive analysis, cache results."""
    # This runs once, then cached
    return expensive_analysis()

# First call: ~$0.05
# Subsequent calls: $0 (cached)
```

### 5. Progressive Context Loading

**Load context progressively:**

```python
# Start with minimal context
context = minimal_context()  # 1K tokens

# Only load more if needed
if agent_needs_more_context():
    context.update(additional_context())  # +2K tokens

# Only as last resort
if still_needs_more():
    context.update(full_context())  # +10K tokens

# Average case: 1K tokens vs always 13K tokens
# Savings: 92%
```

### 6. Choose the Right Model

**Decision tree:**

```python
def choose_model(task):
    if task.requires_complex_reasoning():
        return "sonnet-4.5"

    if task.is_repetitive():
        return "haiku-4.5"

    if task.cost_sensitive() and not task.urgent():
        return "haiku-4.5"

    if task.urgent() and task.critical():
        return "sonnet-4.5"

    # Default to Haiku for cost efficiency
    return "haiku-4.5"
```

### 7. Monitor and Optimize

**Track cost per task type:**

```python
# Identify expensive patterns
expensive_tasks = get_tasks_by_cost(threshold=0.10)

for task in expensive_tasks:
    analyze_cost_drivers(task)
    suggest_optimizations(task)

# Example output:
# Task "codebase analysis" costs $0.15 per run
# Driver: Sending full codebase (100K tokens)
# Optimization: Use indexed summary (5K tokens)
# Potential savings: 90% ($0.135 per run)
```

```

**Before Optimization:**

```yaml
monthly_workflows: 200
avg_tasks_per_workflow: 4
approach: All Sonnet

monthly_cost:
  ai_usage: 200 × $1.05 = $210
  developer_time: Normal workflow
  total_ai: $210/month
  annual_projection: $2,520
```

**After Optimization:**

```yaml
monthly_workflows: 200
avg_tasks_per_workflow: 4
approach: Sonnet planning + Haiku execution

monthly_cost:
  ai_usage: 200 × $0.22 = $44
  developer_time: Same (no change)
  total_ai: $44/month
  annual_projection: $528

savings:
  monthly: $210 - $44 = $166
  annual: $2,520 - $528 = $1,992
  percentage: 79%

impact:
  developer_satisfaction: "Much higher (faster execution)"
  time_savings: "~30 hours/month (parallel execution)"
