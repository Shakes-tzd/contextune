## 🎯 Decision Matrix: Haiku vs Sonnet

| Task Type | Model | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| **Planning** | Sonnet | Complex reasoning required |
| **Guidance** | Sonnet | Educational, teaching |
| **Execution** | Haiku | Repetitive, well-defined |
| **Testing** | Haiku | Automated, templated |
| **Git Operations** | Haiku | Simple commands |

2. **Skills guide, agents execute**
3. **Hybrid model**: Sonnet thinks, Haiku does
4. **Clear separation of concerns**

### Key Learnings from Claude Code Documentation

1. **Agent contexts are isolated** (no pollution)
2. **Model field allows explicit control**
