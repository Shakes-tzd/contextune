## 🎯 Strategic Insight: The Three-Tier Intelligence Model

### Current Problem (v0.2.0)

**All execution happens in main Sonnet conversation:**
```
Main Agent (Sonnet 4.5):
├─ Planning (necessary - complex)
├─ Spawning subagents via Task tool (EXPENSIVE!)
│   ├─ Subagent 1 (Sonnet) - Creates issue, worktree, executes
│   ├─ Subagent 2 (Sonnet) - Creates issue, worktree, executes
│   └─ Subagent 3 (Sonnet) - Creates issue, worktree, executes
└─ All subagents use Sonnet context!

Cost for 5 parallel tasks:
- Main agent: ~10K tokens (Sonnet) = $0.03
- 5 subagents: ~50K tokens each (Sonnet) = 5 × $0.15 = $0.75
Total: $0.78 per parallel workflow
```

### Revolutionary Solution (v0.3.0)

**Hybrid Intelligence: Sonnet orchestrates, Haiku executes:**
```
Main Agent (Sonnet 4.5):
├─ Planning (complex reasoning)
├─ Orchestration (decision-making)
└─ Delegates to Haiku agents ⚡

Haiku Agents (separate contexts):
├─ parallel-task-executor (Haiku) - Autonomous execution
├─ worktree-manager (Haiku) - Git operations
├─ issue-orchestrator (Haiku) - GitHub management
├─ test-runner (Haiku) - Test execution
└─ performance-analyzer (Haiku) - Benchmarking

Cost for 5 parallel tasks:
- Main agent: ~10K tokens (Sonnet) = $0.03
- 5 Haiku agents: ~30K tokens each (Haiku) = 5 × $0.024 = $0.12
Total: $0.15 per parallel workflow

Savings: 81% cost reduction! 🎉
```

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Per-Token Pricing (Claude API)

| Model | Input ($/MTok) | Output ($/MTok) | Use Case |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Sonnet 4.5** | $3.00 | $15.00 | Complex reasoning, planning, orchestration |
| **Haiku 4.5** | $0.80 | $4.00 | Execution, testing, reporting |
| **Savings** | 73% | 73% | **Use Haiku for 80% of work!** |

### Typical Parallel Workflow (5 Tasks)

**Current (All Sonnet):**
```
Main Agent Planning:
- Input: 8K tokens × $3.00/MTok = $0.024
- Output: 2K tokens × $15.00/MTok = $0.030
Subtotal: $0.054

5 Subagents Execution (Sonnet):
- Input per agent: 40K tokens × $3.00/MTok = $0.120
- Output per agent: 10K tokens × $15.00/MTok = $0.150
- Per agent: $0.270
- Total 5 agents: $1.350

Total Cost: $1.404 per workflow
```

**Optimized (Sonnet + Haiku):**
```
Main Agent Planning (Sonnet):
- Input: 8K tokens × $3.00/MTok = $0.024
- Output: 2K tokens × $15.00/MTok = $0.030
Subtotal: $0.054

5 Haiku Agents Execution:
- Input per agent: 30K tokens × $0.80/MTok = $0.024
- Output per agent: 5K tokens × $4.00/MTok = $0.020
- Per agent: $0.044
- Total 5 agents: $0.220

Total Cost: $0.274 per workflow

Savings: $1.13 per workflow (80% reduction!)
```

### Projected Annual Savings

Assuming:
- 100 parallel workflows per month
- 1,200 workflows per year

**Current cost:** 1,200 × $1.40 = **$1,680/year**
**Optimized cost:** 1,200 × $0.27 = **$324/year**

**Annual savings: $1,356 (81% reduction!)**

### Key Principles

1. **Sonnet for Thinking, Haiku for Doing**
   - Complex reasoning → Sonnet
   - Repetitive execution → Haiku
   - Teaching & guidance → Sonnet (Skills)

2. **Context Isolation**
   - Each Haiku agent has its own context
   - No pollution of main conversation
   - Clean, focused execution

3. **Cost Optimization**
   - 80% of work done by Haiku
   - 20% of work done by Sonnet
   - 81% cost reduction overall

4. **Performance Preservation**
   - Haiku 4.5 is fast (~2x faster than Sonnet)
   - Parallel execution still works
   - Context window benefits (200K)

## 🔄 Updated Parallel Execution Workflow

### Before (All Sonnet)

```
User: "Work on auth, dashboard, analytics in parallel"
↓
Main Agent (Sonnet):
├─ Plans tasks
└─ Spawns 3 subagents via Task tool
    ↓
Subagent 1 (Sonnet): Full autonomous execution
Subagent 2 (Sonnet): Full autonomous execution
Subagent 3 (Sonnet): Full autonomous execution

Cost: ~$1.40
Time: ~3 hours work time + setup
```

### After (Sonnet + Haiku Hybrid)

```
User: "Work on auth, dashboard, analytics in parallel"
↓
Skill: parallel-development-expert (Sonnet)
├─ Analyzes tasks
├─ Recommends parallelization
└─ Quantifies savings
↓
User: "Yes, do it"
↓
Main Agent (Sonnet):
├─ Creates parallel execution plan
├─ Validates independence
└─ Delegates to Haiku agents
    ↓
Agent: parallel-task-executor (Haiku) × 3 instances
├─ Instance 1: Auth task
├─ Instance 2: Dashboard task
└─ Instance 3: Analytics task

Each Haiku agent:
1. Creates GitHub issue (via issue-orchestrator Haiku)
2. Creates worktree (via worktree-manager Haiku)
3. Executes task autonomously
4. Runs tests (via test-runner Haiku)
5. Reports completion

Cost: ~$0.27 (81% savings!)
Time: ~3 hours work time + setup (same)
Quality: Same (Haiku perfect for execution)
```

## 🎯 Decision Matrix: When to Use Which Model

| Task Type | Complexity | Model | Why |
|-----------|------------|-------|-----|
| **Planning** | High | Sonnet | Requires complex reasoning |
| **Guidance** | High | Sonnet | Educational, teaching |
| **Orchestration** | High | Sonnet | Coordination, decisions |
| **Execution** | Low | Haiku | Repetitive, well-defined |
| **Testing** | Low | Haiku | Automated, templated |
| **Reporting** | Low | Haiku | Data collection |
| **Git Operations** | Low | Haiku | Simple commands |
| **Issue Creation** | Low | Haiku | Templated |
| **Conflict Resolution** | High | Sonnet | Requires judgment |
| **Architecture Design** | High | Sonnet | Creative problem-solving |

**Rule of Thumb:**
- If task can be described in a template → Haiku
- If task requires "figuring it out" → Sonnet
