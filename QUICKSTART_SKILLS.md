# SlashSense Skills - 5-Minute Quick Start

**Version:** 0.2.0
**Time to Value:** < 5 minutes

---

## 🚀 What Are Skills?

Skills are **autonomous expert capabilities** that activate automatically when you ask questions. No commands to memorize!

**Key Difference:**
```
Slash Commands: You invoke them
    /slashsense:parallel:execute

Skills: Claude invokes them
    "How can I work faster?" → Skill activates automatically!
```

## ⚡ Try It Now (4 Examples)

### 1. Discover Capabilities (2 min)

**Ask:**
```
"What can SlashSense do?"
```

**What Happens:**
- `intent-recognition` skill activates automatically
- Shows you interactive examples
- Demonstrates capabilities
- Suggests what to try next

**Try saying:**
- "What can I do with SlashSense?"
- "Show me examples"
- "How do I use this?"

---

### 2. Speed Up Development (3 min)

**Ask:**
```
"I need to build user auth, dashboard UI, and analytics.
Can I do them faster?"
```

**What Happens:**
- `parallel-development-expert` skill activates
- Analyzes your tasks for independence
- Calculates time savings (e.g., "60% faster!")
- Offers to execute if you agree

**Try saying:**
- "How can I work on multiple features at once?"
- "Speed up development"
- "Work on several things in parallel"

---

### 3. Troubleshoot Issues (2 min)

**Ask:**
```
"I can't remove a worktree, getting 'locked' error"
```

**What Happens:**
- `git-worktree-master` skill activates
- Diagnoses the problem
- Explains the cause
- Provides safe fix with confirmation

**Try saying:**
- "Git worktree issues"
- "How do I clean up old worktrees?"
- "Orphaned branches"

---

### 4. Optimize Performance (3 min)

**Ask:**
```
"My parallel workflow is taking 10 minutes for 3 tasks.
Is that normal?"
```

**What Happens:**
- `performance-optimizer` skill activates
- Benchmarks your workflow
- Identifies bottlenecks
- Recommends optimizations with impact

**Try saying:**
- "Why is this slow?"
- "Can I make parallel execution faster?"
- "Analyze performance"

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Just Ask Questions

```
❌ Don't: "Activate the parallel-development-expert skill"
✅ Do: "How can I work on multiple features?"
```

### 2. Be Specific

```
❌ Vague: "Help with parallel work"
✅ Specific: "I have 3 features to build - can I parallelize them?"
```

### 3. Describe Your Problem

```
❌ Generic: "Git error"
✅ Descriptive: "Getting 'locked' error when removing worktree"
```

### 4. Trust the Guidance

```
Skills provide quantified recommendations:
"This will save 2.3 hours (23% faster!)"

Not vague promises:
"This might be faster"
```

## 🧪 5-Minute Experiment

**Try this workflow (end-to-end):**

1. **Discovery** (1 min)
   ```
   You: "What can SlashSense do?"
   → Learn capabilities
   ```

2. **Analyze** (2 min)
   ```
   You: "I need to build feature X, Y, and Z"
   → Get parallelization analysis
   ```

3. **Execute** (1 min)
   ```
   You: "Work on them in parallel"
   → SlashSense executes optimized workflow
   ```

4. **Monitor** (30s)
   ```
   You: "Show progress"
   → Real-time status
   ```

5. **Optimize** (30s)
   ```
   You: "How's performance?"
   → Get optimization suggestions
   ```

**Total:** 5 minutes from discovery to optimized execution!
