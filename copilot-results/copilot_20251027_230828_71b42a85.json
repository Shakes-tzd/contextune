   $ git commit -m "feat: implement zero-manual-work documentation system with automated context
   preservation

   Implements comprehensive documentation extraction and context preservation system with DRY
   architecture:

   Core Features:
   - SessionEnd extractor hook (hooks/session_end_extractor.py) for automatic documentation
   extraction
   - PreCompact hook (hooks/context_preserver.py) for in-progress context preservation
   - SessionStart hook (hooks/context_restorer.js) for context restoration
   - Installation manifest system (lib/install_manifest.py) for clean uninstallation
   - Extraction-optimized output style (output-styles/extraction-optimized.md) with 700 lines
   - Interactive configuration command (commands/ctx-configure.py) with dual-scope installation

   Configuration & Tooling:
   - Updated hooks.json with PreCompact, SessionStart, and PostSessionEnd hooks
   - Updated ctx-configure.md with interactive flow documentation
   - Enhanced .mcp.json with server configuration
   - Added custom CSS for documentation styling

   Testing & Documentation:
   - Created comprehensive test suites (14 tests, all passing)
     - test_session_end_extractor.py (8 tests)
     - test_ctx_configure_integration.py (6 tests)
   - Design documentation in .plans/decision-tracking-system/
     - AUTOMATED_CONTEXT_PRESERVATION.md
     - COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATION.md
     - CONTEXT_PRESERVING_OUTPUT_STYLE.md
     - DRY_CONTEXT_ARCHITECTURE.md
     - IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
     - OUTPUT_STYLE_FOR_EXTRACTION.md
     - WRITE_TOOL_VS_EXTRACTION_ANALYSIS.md

   Additional:
   - CLI orchestrator design documents and test files
   - Enhanced tool cost tracker with improved cost tracking
   - Project feedback documentation
   - Scratch pad for development notes

   This implements a zero-manual-work documentation system following DRY principles,
   eliminating redundant 'write plan to file' steps while preserving context across
   sessions through automated extraction and restoration."
