## 🔬 Research Findings

### 1. Agent vs Skill Distinction

**Skills (Model-Invoked):**
- Activated automatically by Claude
- Part of main conversation
- Educational and guidance-focused
- Example: parallel-development-expert

**Agents (User/System-Invoked):**
- Separate context windows
- Can specify model (haiku/sonnet/opus)
- Task-specific execution
- Example: parallel-task-executor

**Key Insight:** Use Skills for teaching, Agents for doing!

### 2. Haiku 4.5 Capabilities

**Pricing:**
- Input: $0.80/MTok (vs $3.00 Sonnet) = **73% cheaper**
- Output: $4.00/MTok (vs $15.00 Sonnet) = **73% cheaper**

**Performance:**
- Response time: 1-2s (vs 3-5s Sonnet) = **~2x faster**
- Context window: 200K (same as Sonnet) = **No limitations**

**Quality:**
- Perfect for well-defined tasks ✅
- Not for complex reasoning ❌
- Ideal for execution ✅

**Strategic Implication:** Use Haiku for 80% of work, Sonnet for 20% of thinking!

### 3. E2E Tester Example Analysis

**Key Learnings:**
```yaml
model: haiku  # Explicit model selection
allowed-tools: [specific tools]  # Limited permissions
description: "...systematic test scenarios..."  # When to invoke
```

**Pattern:**
1. Well-defined workflow (systematic testing)
2. Templated operations (issue creation)
3. Evidence collection (screenshots, logs)
4. Clear reporting (structured format)

**Cost:** ~$0.03 per test run (vs $0.15 Sonnet) = **80% savings**

**Insight:** Haiku perfect for repetitive, structured tasks!

### 4. Software Architect Skill Analysis

**Key Learnings:**
- Stays in main conversation (teaching)
- Decomposes problems (complex reasoning)
- Provides guidance (educational)
- No execution (delegates to others)

**Pattern:** Sonnet for thinking, others for doing

**Insight:** Skills guide, Agents execute!

## 💰 Cost Analysis (The Killer Feature)

### Scenario: 5 Parallel Tasks (Typical Workflow)

**Current (All Sonnet):**
```
Main Agent Planning:
├─ Input: 8K tokens × $3.00/MTok = $0.024
└─ Output: 2K tokens × $15.00/MTok = $0.030
Subtotal: $0.054

5 Sonnet Subagents:
├─ Input each: 40K × $3.00/MTok = $0.120
├─ Output each: 10K × $15.00/MTok = $0.150
├─ Per agent: $0.270
└─ Total 5: $1.350

TOTAL: $1.404 per workflow
```

**Optimized (Sonnet + Haiku):**
```
Main Agent Planning (Sonnet):
├─ Input: 8K tokens × $3.00/MTok = $0.024
└─ Output: 2K tokens × $15.00/MTok = $0.030
Subtotal: $0.054

5 Haiku Agents:
├─ Input each: 30K × $0.80/MTok = $0.024
├─ Output each: 5K × $4.00/MTok = $0.020
├─ Per agent: $0.044
└─ Total 5: $0.220

TOTAL: $0.274 per workflow

SAVINGS: $1.13 per workflow (81% reduction!)
```

### Annual Projection

**Assumptions:**
- 100 workflows/month
- 1,200 workflows/year

**Current:** 1,200 × $1.40 = **$1,680/year**
**Optimized:** 1,200 × $0.27 = **$324/year**

**ANNUAL SAVINGS: $1,356 (81% reduction)**

This is enough to pay for:
- Claude Code Pro subscription ($20/mo = $240/year)
- + 5 additional tools/plugins
- + Coffee for the team
- **Still saving $1,000+/year!**

**Cost Optimization:**
- Expensive Sonnet for complex thinking (20% of work)
- Cheap Haiku for simple execution (80% of work)
- Result: 81% cost reduction!

**Performance:**
- Haiku 2x faster response time
- Parallel execution still works
- No functional limitations

**Quality:**
- Sonnet ensures good planning
- Haiku perfect for execution
- Same output quality
- Better than before (focused contexts)

## 🎯 Decision Matrix: Model Selection

| Task Characteristic | Model | Why |
|-------------------|-------|-----|
| **Complex reasoning required** | Sonnet | Haiku not designed for this |
| **Creative problem-solving** | Sonnet | Need sophisticated thinking |
| **Ambiguous requirements** | Sonnet | Need to "figure it out" |
| **Well-defined workflow** | Haiku | Cheap + fast for execution |
| **Templated operations** | Haiku | No reasoning needed |
| **Repetitive tasks** | Haiku | Cost-effective |
| **Simple decision trees** | Haiku | Haiku can handle this |
| **Data collection** | Haiku | Fast and cheap |
| **Reporting** | Haiku | Structured output |
| **Teaching/guidance** | Sonnet | Educational value |

**Rule of Thumb:**
- Can you write a template for it? → Haiku
- Does it require "judgment"? → Sonnet

## 🌟 The Big Picture

### Before Contextune

```
User: "I need to implement features X, Y, Z"

Traditional Approach:
1. Read documentation (20 min)
2. Figure out commands (10 min)
3. Set up worktrees manually (15 min)
4. Work sequentially (8 hours)
5. Merge and test (30 min)

Total: 8 hours 75 minutes
Cost: No Claude usage (manual work)
Result: Slow, tedious, error-prone
```

### With Contextune v0.1.0 (Intent Detection)

```
User: "Work on X, Y, Z"

Contextune:
1. Detects intent (0.02ms)
2. Maps to /contextune:parallel:execute
3. Creates worktrees automatically
4. Executes in parallel (3 hours)

Total: 3 hours
Cost: $1.40 (All Sonnet)
Result: Fast, automated, but expensive
```

### With Contextune v0.2.0 (+ Skills)

```
User: "How can I work on X, Y, Z faster?"

Contextune:
1. Skill activates (parallel-development-expert)
2. Analyzes: "Sequential 8h → Parallel 3h (62% faster!)"
3. User: "Do it!"
4. Executes with Skills guidance

Total: 3 hours
Cost: $1.40 (All Sonnet)
Result: Fast, guided, but expensive
```

### With Contextune v0.3.0 (+ Haiku Agents) 🚀

```
User: "How can I work on X, Y, Z faster?"

Contextune:
1. Skill activates (parallel-development-expert)
2. Analyzes: "Sequential 8h → Parallel 3h (62% faster!)"
3. Shows: "Cost: $0.27 (vs $1.40 - 81% savings!)"
4. User: "Do it!"
5. Haiku agents execute (fast, cheap, autonomous)

Total: 3 hours
Cost: $0.27 (Haiku optimization!)
Result: Fast, guided, AND cheap!

Annual savings: $1,356/year
Performance: 2x faster responses
Quality: Same as before
```

**This is the FUTURE of development assistance!**
